# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Overview

This week’s challenge requires me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on certain criteria they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The app will ask the user for the following before creating a random password:
- Your desired password length (from 10 to 64 characters)
- Whether you'd like to use uppercase characters
- Whether you'd like to use lowercase characters
- Whether you'd like to use numeric characters
- Whether you'd like to use special characters

Here is the link to the deployed app:
